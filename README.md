# TaskManagingFinal

We made a task managing software that is able to display any tasks currently in the system, create a new task,
look up a task and its comments, update a task and add comments to a task.

# To run

1. Clone the Git repository to your local machine
2. Make sure Docker and a recent version of Python
3. Copy .env_sample and rename the new file .env
4. Enter data for each of the fields in .env (remove the curly braces)
5. Navigate to the main folder of the project and run `python run.py`. This will implicitly call `docker compose up -d`
6. To destroy the docker compose stack and the database, run `python reset.py`

If this fails to run, let me know and I can send a screen recording

# Submission answers

* This took about 15-18 hours to complete.
* I thought it was a cool final as it let us do what we wanted and encapsulated a wide range of things.
* I wish we had a few more days for polish
